BootUp is a functional clone of the Kickstarter website. It is designed to allow content creators to apply for crowdfunding directly from their potential customer: instead of raising venture capital and lunching a product on the hope of generating interest, people with ideas can pitch them to the world and get funded ahead of even making their product. 

Creators can create projects and offer rewards to users who back their project. Users can browse and discover different projects that might interest them, and use their money to support products or caues which interest them and which they would like to see come to pass. This model allows passion and dedication, not hope or promise of profits, to support the creation of new and innovative products and see the release of things which would otherwise die in a bank's loan office.
